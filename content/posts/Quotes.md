"There areonly two kinds of theories: those that are wrong and those that are incomplete."
```
-- Karl Popper

```
"We look for medicine to be an orderly field of knowledge and procedure.  
But it is not.  It is an imperfect science, an enterprise of constantly

and at the same time lives on the line"
```
--Atul Gawande, *Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science*, 2003
