![Protesters took part in months of demonstrations last year](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/91A6/production/_113168273_0dd33bd2-bacf-43c1-845c-9b6d411e7cc6.jpg)

Even among world-shattering news coming out of US almost every day, the [Hong Kongâ€™s National Security Law][ref1] stands out to affect Americans long term.


The CCP passed Hong Kong National Security Law to curb pro-democracy and pro-autonomy movement in Hong Kong. The law codifies crimes against secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with any foreign entities, from institution to persons. The secession law (Article 20) is broad to cover any actions aiming at undermining national unity. This includes Facebook posts, twitter tweets, or Reddit posts that Chinese authority, not HK authority, feels to undermine national unity.

So, why does this matter to Americans?

Leaving all geopolitics and support for democracy discussions aside, this Law covers non-Hong Kong residents and actions outside of Hong Kong in Article 38 The law has jurisdiction over anyone on the planet Earth for offenses happened anywhere, including Americans. If one were to support pro-HK democracy organizations in US, the authority can arrest the person when traveling through HK. While the chance of an average American gets arrested for pressing a Facebook like on a pro-HK democracy post is slim, the risk is still there. 

Americans traveling to Asia in post-COVID19 world should exercise caution.
