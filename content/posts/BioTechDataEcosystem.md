# Biotech Data Ecosystem as a Data Product

## THE PROBLEM

Although integrating multi-modal biomedical data offers enormous opportunities to propel therapeutic discovery, most biotech companies' data strategy are ineffective.

## WHY IT HAPPENS

Often time biotech companies fail to establish the foundation for future data usage during data generation.  Individual teams capture data in silo for each application that cannot easily be repurposed.

## THE PROBLEM

Create an environment to support standard data products that can be tailored to suit the needs of various type of users and applications.  The products can be managed by dedicated teams within business units, supported by a central function that coordinates and standardizes design.

Every biotech company recognizes the power of integrating biomedical data, yet most company struggle to leverage its potentials.  The problem is often that the initial data investement focuses on customized pipelines for data generation support while data types, volume, and application technologies rapidly evolve in unpredictable ways.  Data from different modalities naturally diverge, obstructing future repurposing and integration.  As companies devise plan to leverage data to guide decision making, it is common to find that the overhead to harmonize the data is overwhelming.  


## EXAMPLE

The H3 Biomedicine, the former oncology drug discovery subsidiary of Eisai Pharmaceutical, was established in 2011 

## THE SOLUTION

Whether companies decide to redesign an organization data environment (top-bottom) or restructure key functional areas individually (bottom-up) for integration, a consistent data framework is needed to improve the chance of success.





Developing data as a product offers a flexible framework to repurpose data for different applications. As in the case of developing a software, organization would create a baseline offering that can address the core user needs and develop modularized features that can be added on.

Data-as-a-Product: A data science framework for data collaborations
Led by Afshin Mashadi-Hossein, Sr Principal Scientist at Bristol Myers Squibb

Abstract:
For data science teams, data preparation takes substantial investment of time, data science expertise and subject matter proficiency. However, as the name implies, data preparation is typically viewed merely as a means to an end, encouraging creation of expensive but often single-use and fragile elements in data analysis workflows.  

Rather than seeing data preparation as an obstacle to be removed, we propose a framework that recognizes the time and expertise invested in data preparation and seeks to maximize the value that can be derived from it. 

Viewing analysis-ready data as a multi-purpose, modularly built product that should lend itself to collaborative development and maintenance, the framework of Data-as-a-Product (DaaP) aims to remove barriers to version tracking and collaborative data development and maintenance. Specifically, the framework, which is entirely implemented in R, enables joint code and data versioning based on git, standardizes metadata capture, tracks R packages used, and encourages best practices such as adherence to functional programming and use of data testing. 

Collectively, the patterns established by the DaaP framework can help data science teams transition from developing expensive, single-use “wrangled” datasets to building maintainable, version-controlled, and extendable data products that could serve as reliable components of their data analyses workflows.
