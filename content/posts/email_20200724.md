Dear all,

As Angela Merkel said in the Harvard commencement last year: "Time and time again, we need to be prepared to keep bring things to an end in order to feel the magic of new beginnings."   And after a fantastic decade run along with you,  it is my time to bid adieu today and to seek a new beginning.

Unfortunately we can't have one for the road as current colleagues, yet, as many great things in life, what matters is the journey itself. I do hope we will be able to congregate as friends in the very near future.  My personal email is yaoyu.e.wang@gmail.com.  Please feel free to shot me a line.

Stay safe.  Live long and prosper.

Best,
Yaoyu

Yaoyu,
I feel honored you included me in this very special list. I have nothing but happiness for you and confidence that you will succeed in whatever your next step is.
Let's make sure we get that drink together sometime in the future.
Stay in touch.
All the best,
Kimbie
