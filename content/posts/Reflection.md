1. Reflect back on all the jobs (paid and unpaid) you've held. Describe the times when you felt your work was honored, and you were working into your mission, and fully tapping into your talents, your values and your special strengths. Think about the times you felt really successful and happy in your role: showing up as your Best Self.

- Dyrnamics:  start up company to come up with a non-invasive prognosis marker for cardiovascular disease.  Working with the team on VC pitch strategy,  develop value-based argument for the research, defend the benefits of the research
- CCCB:  Growing a team of 15 people, work with internal team to design research consulting offerings and business models, negotiate with DFCI administration on setting up a novel lease-to-buy contract structure to obtain new sequencer.


2. What impact or contributions have you made by being who you are?  Think back throughout your career, as well as time with friends and family, or any volunteer activities. Sometimes it is the small things that pack a big punch. Sometimes the impact comes from a single sentence! The impact doesn't have to be a big, grand gesture, to have had a big impact on someone else.



3. What brings you joy? What lights you up? What brings you energy?

- Establish, grow, and maintain a working environment that people in there are being their best professional self and happy.  

4. What impact or contributions would you like to be making to the world—either in your career or elsewhere? In five years, what would you like to be able to say about what you've accomplished? 

-  I have transformed a biotech organization into a high efficient and joyful place to bring new technologies into the field

5. What would you like to leave as your legacy? OK if no clear direction . . . yet, but might be helpful to consider.

-  Not sure yet.  I do enjoy people who worked for me to remember me as someone they want to work with again.
