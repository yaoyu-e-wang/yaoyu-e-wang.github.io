      <description>Dear all,
As Angela Merkel said in the Harvard commencement last year: &amp;ldquo;Time and time again, we need to be prepared to keep bring things to an end in order to feel the magic of new beginnings.&amp;rdquo; And after a fantastic decade run along with you, it is my time to bid adieu today and to seek a new beginning.
Unfortunately we can&amp;rsquo;t have one for the road as current colleagues, yet, as many great things in life, what matters is the journey itself.</description>
