<h3 id="covid19-lockdown-march-2020">COVID19 Lockdown March, 2020</h3>
<pre><code class="language-{}" data-lang="{}">Members of the Biostatistics Department,

On March 9, I left my office in Building 2 of the Harvard Chan School, ready to get away for a few days during my son Adam's spring break. COVID-19 was something we were already worrying about and our department had been proactive in preparing to offer classes and to conduct thesis exams over Zoom. I was sure that whatever we were facing, we would deal with it quickly, and that before long things would be back to normal. Now, more than seventeen weeks later, it seems like things are farther from normal and more chaotic every day and every morning seems to bring a new crisis. If you are like me, the seemingly endless leap from challenge to problem to crisis is exhausting.

So I just want to do two things. The first it to say &quot;Thank you.&quot; I know I am going to forget event and people, so my apologies in advance. But here goes.

Thanks to everyone, especially our staff members, who worked hard to get our department ready for the COVID shutdown--far ahead of anyone else at the school.

Thanks to the faculty, instructors, staff, TAs, and students work worked hard to adapt instruction to the online world and who worked together to make the experience as rich as possible.

Thanks to Geryel and Jelelna and Isabella and Harrison for brainstorming and creating a virtual graduation event that gave us the chance to celebrate our students.

Thanks to everyone who embraced the Black Lives Matter protests and took the opportunity to reflect on our department and to commit advancing anti-racism as a core principle for our community--and especially thanks to those who volunteered to be involved in our ongoing efforts to improve diversity and inclusion in our department.

Thanks to Priti and Marcello for turning our Summer Program into an online program and the mentors who let the participants experience research, learning they have what it takes.

Thanks to our postdocs and students who have worked with us, and our staff--especially Susan Luvisi--who have been helping to navigate sudden changes in OPT policies.

Thanks to Sherley and Elizabeth and the finance and administrative teams who have worked to close out the 2020 fiscal year and to prepare a budget--and advocate for the department--so we can continue to function effectively.

Thanks to everyone who has helped in dealing with this week's sudden change in student visa policies--especially Jelena, Geryel, Paige, Rajarshi, David W, Erin L, JP, Heather, Pete K, and others--who are doing everything we can to ensure our students are protected and receive the educations they came to us to receive.

And thanks to everyone in the department for their patience and understanding when the best answer I can give is &quot;I don't know, we are working on it.&quot;

The second thing I want to do is to promise you that the overall leadership team in the department is really working hard to stay on top of things. In every crisis, bigger or smaller, people have stepped up, dropped what they are doing, and taken on the task of figuring out how to preserve our community and to protect its members. Brent and Elizabeth have your backs--and I am not sure either one of them sleeps any more. I can't think of any better advocate for our students than Paige (although all the other program directors are clearly as dedicated). And there are so many other people, day to day, who step in to try to help the department navigate through the chaos.

So I promise. We are working on solving the problems and averting the threats that face the department. We are very fortunate to have such amazing people committed to our department and its mission. And I am very fortunate to have you all as amazing colleagues, collaborators, and friends. And I promise to do all I can to support you, to advocate for you, to think creatively, and to work to keep our department healthy and functioning.

John

<h3 id="christmas">Christmas</h3>
<pre><code class="language-{}" data-lang="{}">Friends,

I just want to send a quick note to wish all of you a peaceful, restful time this winter break. During the semester, t is easy to get caught up in the day-to-day grind and forget the things that are truly important. My family and I will be spending time together, visiting relatives, catching up with friends, and taking time for ourselves. Whether you celebrate Hanukah, Christmas, Kwanza, some other holiday, or none at all, I wish each of you peace, joy, and comfort as you look back at all you have accomplished in the past year and look forward to new year that awaits us. I look forward to seeing you all in 2020 and working with you toward our shared goals of discovering new ways to advance human health, to train the next generation of leaders in quantitative health science, and to strive each day to become better versions of ourselves.

Happy Holidays,
John
</code></pre><h3 id="thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</h3>
<h4 id="jq-2020">JQ 2020</h4>
<pre><code class="language-{}" data-lang="{}">Members of the Biostatistics Department,

Thanksgiving Recess begins tomorrow. I can't think of a year in which I have been more excited for a &quot;break&quot; nor one during which I have been more committed to taking a day or two off to not do work (although I will be chasing Adam to do his calculus homework and to work on his English paper).

In the US, Thanksgiving is widely recognized as the most universally celebrated holiday, in large part because it is not tied to any particular religious tradition or particular ethnic background. Thanksgiving traces its roots back to a feast that was held in 1621 at which early English settlers in Massachusetts thanked the native Wampanoag people who helped them survive and taught them to farm and fish the local streams--helping them avoid malnutrition and starvation. While the celebration was largely regional, in 1863, at the height of the US Civil War, Abraham Lincoln signed a proclamation instituting a national day of Thanksgiving as an annual holiday. It has become a day when friends and families gather together, often for the now traditional turkey dinner (Mary is Greek, so she and Adam will probably have lamb), and (for some) to spend some time reflecting on the things they have for which they should be thankful.

In keeping with the tradition of reflecting on the year, I want to thank you all again for your commitment to each other, to our department, and to our shared mission of doing world-leading research in quantitative health science and training the next generation of leaders in the field. This has been an extremely challenging year by any measure and but we have come through it relatively unscathed. And I feel that, with one or more vaccine candidates in hand, and a government that will be more open to science and to respecting people for their differences and experiences, we can make the next year one that will bring us back to working and learning together in person.

I personally am thankful to have a job, to have my family, to our family being healthy, and for having all of you in my life. Because I am concerned about the health of all my friends and family, we'll be spending the weekend together without any visitors, taking a hike or two in the local woods, and catching up on &quot;His Dark Materials,&quot; &quot;Star Trek: Discovery,&quot; and &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; (I call Adam the &quot;Boydelorian&quot; and he calls his mother the &quot;Momdelorian.&quot; This is the way.) And, of course, working on editing a few papers.

I hope all of you have a wonderful, save, happy, and restful Thanksgiving holiday and return ready to sprint to the end of the semester.

<h3 id="2020-presidential-election">2020 Presidential Election</h3>
<h4 id="jq-election-day">JQ Election Day</h4>
<pre><code class="language-{}" data-lang="{}">Members of the Biostatistics Department,

I want to echo Michelle's sentiments around voting and election day. I see casting one's vote as an important component of the practice of public health as it gives each of us a voice in setting a direction in government that will lead to changes in policy. There are many issues on the ballot this year, either directly or indirectly, that will directly affect things that we all value--from protecting the environment, to addressing the health impacts of inequalities, to ensuring access to health care, your voice does. Because of the way our electoral system works, people sometimes feel their voice doesn't matter. But by voting, we can join our voices with other like minded individuals and send a message to our government that our priorities matter.

John
</code></pre><h4 id="jq-post-election">JQ Post Election</h4>
<pre><code class="language-{}" data-lang="{}">Members of our Department,

As everyone almost certainly knows by now, the 2020 Presidential Election has been called and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been declared the winners. I think all of us can breathe a sigh of relief that the uncertainty of the past few days (or weeks) is now over and we can look to the future.

As we do, I want to remind everyone of the values we hold as a department and a community. While many of us are likely happy with the result, there may well be others who wished for a different result. Part of the problem with American politics over the past many years has been that we too often vilify those who disagree with us and question their motives rather than trying to understand their point of view. Certainly not everyone who supported Trump is a racist in the same way that not everyone supporting Biden is a socialist.

It seems like more than anything, this election should serve as a reminder that we all need to work together in a respectful manner to make our Department, our School, our Country, and our World a better place. Going forward, we have a unique opportunity to restore the faith of those around us in the value of good science, backed by robust data and analytical methods, for making decisions to improve human health and welfare. This is not a liberal perspective or a conservative perspective. This is a scientific perspective---something that I think we all hold in common.

I hope everyone takes a few minutes this weekend to take a deep breath, to relax and refresh, and to return to work and class on Monday understanding that we are a community of scholars who both individually and collectively can make real, positive differences in our world.

John
</code></pre><h4 id="post-election-uncertainty">Post-Election uncertainty</h4>
<pre><code class="language-{}" data-lang="{}">Members of the Biostatistics Department,

As I sit on my couch at 3:00 am, watching the election returns, it is increasingly clear that we will likely not know the winner of this year's presidential election for a number of days. Given the divisive state of the politics in our country, the lack of a clear decision is even more troubling than it might be under other circumstances. If you are feeling anxious, depressed, or uneasy, you are not alone. Take time tomorrow to catch your breath, to reorient yourself, to reach out to friends, family, and colleagues who can help you as we collectively sort things out.

I want to reiterate what I wrote a few days ago--regardless of the outcome of this election, our department will uphold and promote our shared values. We will continue building a culture of inclusivity and mutual support. And we will continue to be a department that welcomes and supports the members of our community. Whatever the future holds, I feel confident that we all can face it together.

John
