        <h2 id="a-passion-for-healthcare-tell-us-why-you-are-passionate-about-healthcare">A passion for healthcare. Tell us why you are passionate about healthcare</h2>
<p>After I graduated from college with a computer science degree,  my first job was as research contractor for Pfizer Computational Science division.   At that time,  I worked with the research team to develop software to perform in silico small molecule screening.  It was my first revelation that data mining and modeling can drastically excellerate drug discovery process that not only save money for the company and save time from development to market of the patients.  It is this excitement of using data to move the develop of better treatment that lead me to a bioinformatics Ph.D.  I focused on HIV therapeutic target identification strategy using Big Data, and that has been theme for my career for more than a decade:  looking for strategies to communicate with data to speed up and improve our ways of developing treatments.  Because I believe for long time, with the proper information technology, we can understand how human and disease interact. And using that inforamtion to rapidly develop highly precise and effective therapeutics for patients.</p>
<h2 id="knowing-when-to-take-risks-think-about-a-time-you-had-to-take-a-risk-what-would-you-do-differently-if-you-had-to-do-it-again">Knowing when to take risks. Think about a time you had to take a risk, what would you do differently if you had to do it again?</h2>
<p>One of the biggest risk I took was the decision to heavily involve in the startup company Dyrnamics back in 2016.  During that time, I had a collaboration with MGH cardiology department. We developed a novel prognosis biomarker for myocardial infarction patients using liquid biopsy, namely blood plasma.  By using our current understanding of how specific small RNA that modulate cell expression are excreted into the blood stream  in patients, we can construct a dynamic biomarkers by looking at these miRNA with very good precision of how patient is doing at the time.  Our preliminary results were quite promising, so we started Dyrnamics with the hope to bring more financial resource to develop this technology closer to a clinical product to help guide therapeutic options.  It was a great time commitment, and I had to turn down a few career opportunities to follow through this endevear.  We had a great team to formulate the business model, construct pitch deck, and obtain further prelimiary results.  However,  we were not able to secure funding after 2 years and decided to resolve the company.  In hind side,  our business model and market analysis were overly optimistic. We would have benefitted early on to seek more external critics on business model and get a better sense on how invester evaluate biomarker technology and risk.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-multiple-perspectives-and-then-thinking-critically-about-them-to-shape-your-own-opinion">Understanding multiple perspectives. And then thinking critically about them to shape your own opinion.</h2>
<h2 id="caring-about-your-community-whether-that-is-your-city-your-family-or-your-startup-team-we-are-looking-for-people-that-want-to-make-an-impact">Caring about your community. Whether that is your city, your family, or your startup team, we are looking for people that want to make an impact.</h2>
